Alignment is a restriction on which memory positions a value's first byte can be stored. (It is needed to improve performance on processors and to permit use of certain instructions that works only on data with particular alignment, for example SSE need to be aligned to 16 bytes, while AVX to 32 bytes.)

Alignment of 16 means that memory addresses that are a multiple of 16 are the only valid addresses.

```cpp
alignas
```

force alignment to the required number of bytes. You can only align to powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and etc.

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    alignas(16) int a[4];
    alignas(1024) int b[4];

	//alignas(1), alignas(3) and etc are illegal.
}
```

the other keyword

```cpp
alignof
```

is very convenient, you cannot do something like

```cpp
int a[4];
assert(a % 16 == 0); // check if alignment is to 16 bytes: WRONG compiler error
```

but you can do

```cpp
assert(alignof(a) == 16);
assert(alignof(b) == 1024);
```

note that in reality this is more strict than a simple "%" (modulus) operation. In fact we know that something aligned to 1024 bytes is necessarily aligned to 1, 2, 4, 8 bytes but

```cpp
 assert(alignof(b) == 32); // fail.
```

So to be more precise, "alignof" returns the greatest power of 2 to wich something is aligned.

Also alignof is a nice way to know in advance minimum alignment requirement for basic datatypes (it will probably return 1 for chars, 4 for float etc.).

Still legal:

```cpp
alignas(alignof(float)) float SqDistance;
```
