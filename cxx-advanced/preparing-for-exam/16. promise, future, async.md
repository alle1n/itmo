### promise & future examples

```cpp
// Create a promise
std::promise<int> promise;

// And get its future
std::future<int> future = promise.get_future();

// You can also get a shared future this way, by the way! (Choose one please)
std::shared_future<int> shared_future = promise.get_future();

// Now suppose we passed promise to a separate thread.
// And in the main thread we call...
int val = future.get(); // This will block!

// Until, that is, we set the future's value via the promise
promise.set_value(10); // In the separate thread

// So now in the main thread, if we try to access val...
std::cout << val << std::endl;

// Output: 10
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <future>
 
void initiazer(std::promise<int> * promObj) {
    std::cout<<"Inside Thread"<<std::endl;
	promObj->set_value(35);
}
 
int main() {
    std::promise<int> promiseObj;
    std::future<int> futureObj = promiseObj.get_future();
    std::thread th(initiazer, &promiseObj);
    std::cout << futureObj.get() << std::endl;
    th.join();
    return 0;
}
```

### std::async

The simplest call to `async` is to just pass in a callback function as an argument, and let the system handle it for you.

```cpp
auto future = std::async(some_function, arg_1, arg_2);
```

Do note that `async` does support parallelism, just that the default constructor manages threads for you and may possibly not run the passed functions in a thread. You'll have to explicitly tell it to run the function in a new thread.

Also, since Linux threads run sequentially by default, it's especially important to force the functions to run in separate threads. We'll see how to do that later.

##### std::async launch policies

There are three ways to launch an async task:

* `std::launch::async` - Guarantees launch in a separate thread
* `std::launch::deferred` - Function will only be called on `get()`
* `std::launch::async | std::launch::deferred` - Default behavior. Defer to system.

I like to run `async` tasks with the `std::launch::async` profile so I can have some semblance of control over the threads. Just **add it in as the first argument!**

```cpp
auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, some_function, arg_1, arg_2);
```

Another examples:

```cpp
// Pass in function pointer
auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, some_function, arg_1, arg_2);

// Pass in function reference
auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, &some_function, arg_1, arg_2);

// Pass in function object
struct SomeFunctionObject {
	void operator() (int arg_1){}
};

auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, SomeFunctionObject(), arg_1);

// Lambda function
auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, [](){});
```
